                <h1>ðŸ’­ Programming Principles</h1>
                <p>Some of these are common tropes in the industry, and some are more "original", distilled from years of working with great people.</p>
                <h2>âš¾ Three strikes and refactor</h2>
                <p>When trying to use something that doesn't "feel right" (e.g. a name, the order or amount of parameters, etc.), resist the urge to refactor it immediately, but take note of it. If it happens two more times, then go for it.</p>
                <p>Note that those times can come from someone else, for example in a code review: if you've already thought about changing something, and someone in a code review points it out as well, that's a second strike!</p>
                <h2>ðŸªž Symmetry as a design guide</h2>
                <p>In general, if there's a way to "add" something, it's a good idea to have a way to "remove" it. This could be literally, or figuratively symmetric (e.g. a `Queue` allows to "add" particular elements, but only "remove" from the front; that's OK)<p>
                <h2>ðŸ’© Wrong code should look wrong</h2>
                <p>Dependending on the language you are using, you might have access to linters/static code analyzers (think <a href="https://rubocop.org/">Rubocop</a>, <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net">FindBugs</a>, <a href="https://errorprone.info">ErrorProne</a>, <a href="http://pychecker.sourceforge.net">PyChecker</a>, etc.).</p>
                <p>Sometimes, you might need to silence them (e.g. when just setting them up in an existing project, you may not be able/want to fix everything). Use explicit/per-line annotations to disable checking in <em>each validation</em>, instead of hiding them in a TODO file. The code will look uglier, and that's fine: it signals where the problems are, and avoids per-file allowlists that can introduce regressions.</p>
