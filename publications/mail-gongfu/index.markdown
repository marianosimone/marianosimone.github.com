# Being an Email Kung Fu Master
功夫 (gōngfu, or Kung Fu, as known to westerns) is a chinese concept that refers to a skill achieved through hard work and practice. Even though the westernized "Kung Fu" is almost always connected to martial arts, I use the term as it's well-known.

As the term implies, you can have Kung Fu in any skill. In this article, I'll expose some tools and techniques that I use to have a harmonious relationship with my emails. This knowledge was accumulated through the years and with the 功夫 characteristics, so I consider myself to have some sort of email功夫, and I want to document and share it with you.

# How To Read This Guide
The techniques and weapons (tools) are separated in three sections: "Writting Emails", "Managing email" and "GMail-specific". This distinction is because GMail has changed the way email is writen/read/managed in such a way that many of the things you can do with it are not available in other contexts (luckily, this seems to be changing thanks to plugins for other email-clients)

All techniques will have a name inspired by the kind-of-esoteric way Kung Fu movements (now I AM referring to Kung Fu as a martial art) are named. By "esoteric" I mean stuff like the tàijíquán movement "The White Crane Spreads Its Wings"... I think you'll get the point.

# Writting emails
## Techniques
### "The Words That Flow Alone": keeping it short
> The good, if brief, is two times good

There’s only one reason we write emails: we want to comunicate with each other. Sometimes, it may be just small-talk, but more often than not, we want to say something that the reader can understand, take into consideration and even remember.

There are some [radical approaches](http://three.sentenc.es/) to maintain some discipline on [writting short emails](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/18/3-sentence-emails/), but I tend to follow the following rule of thumb:

- One sentence to (re)introduce myself (if necessary)
- One or two sentences to explain the issue at hand. It may be a summary of a project I'm working on, a movie I recently watched or a product I want to buy or make a complaint about.
- One sentence to express what I'm excpecting the reader to do about that issue. It may be an action, a reply, etc.

As it's been said countless times (even though I just remember about seven places where I read about [that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)), we (i.e. the one who's reading) can only handle about seven "items" at once. Remember this while writting an email, and you'll be OK.

### "The Bold Word Catches The Passing Eye": emphasizing keywords
*This technique was taught to me by Sebastián Planes, a former student of "Problem Analysis and Solving" at [F.I.U.B.A.](http://www.fi.uba.ar)*

If you couldn't (or didn't want) to master "The Words That Flow Alone" techinque, it's useful to **let the other(s) know** at a glance what are the **key points** of your message.

You can achieve this by:
- **Marking keywords** with a **bold** typeface (if you use rich-formatting)
- Using UPPERCASE letters (as it's [considered shouting in netiquette](http://email.about.com/od/netiquettetips/qt/Writing-In-All-Caps-Is-Like-Shouting.htm), you should avoid using it too much)
- Using \_\_Some Kind Of Custom Notation\_\_

### "The One That Goes And Comes Back": keep one question per mail

# Managing email
### "The Emptiness Of The Box Makes It Useful": a clutter-free inbox

### "The Accumulation Of The Useless Is Wasteful": a clutter-free account

### "The One Is One, And Is Many": multiple (maybe fake) accounts

address tags using (+)

## Weapons
### "Kunai": Handle it later
Like [Scorpio's weapon](http://mortalkombat.wikia.com/wiki/Kunai), email can be asked to return later. Sometimes, there's a message you won't be handling right now, and you don't want it cluttering your inbox, do you?

The simplest (and smartest) way of achieving this, so far, is using Gmail Snooze, a Google App Script that gives you some tags to apply to your emails (like Snooze 1 day, Snooze 2 days... you get the idea, right?).

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="publications/mail-gongfu/img/snooze-gmail.png" alt="Applying a snooze tag to an email"/>
</div>

To install (and, if you want, understand) it, just follow the guide at [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5825634/how-to-add-a-snooze-button-to-gmail-no-extensions-required) or the [Google Apps Developer Blog](http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2011/07/gmail-snooze-with-apps-script.html)

Another option (wich I have not tested, as I don't like the 3rd party browser-extension approach) is [Boomerang](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/). The good thing about is that not only snoozes emails, but it also allows you to schedule messages. If you trust this guys enough, you should check'em out.
