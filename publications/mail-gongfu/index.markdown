# Being an Email Kung Fu Master
功夫 (gōngfu, or Kung Fu, as known to westerns) is a chinese concept that refers to a skill achieved through hard work and practice. Even though the westernized "Kung Fu" is almost always connected to martial arts, I use the term as it's well-known.

As the term implies, you can have Kung Fu in any skill. In this article, I'll expose some tools and techniques that I use to have a harmonious relationship with my emails. This knowledge was accumulated through the years and with the 功夫 characteristics, so I consider myself to have some sort of email功夫, and I want to document and share it with you.

# How To Read This Guide
The techniques and weapons (tools) are separated in two sections: "General email" and "GMail-specific". This distinction is because GMail has changed the way email is writen/read/managed in such a way that many of the things you can do with it are not available in other contexts (luckily, this seems to be changing thanks to plugins for other email-clients)

All techniques will have a name inspired by the kind-of-esoteric way Kung Fu movements (now I AM referring to Kung Fu as a martial art) are named. By "esoteric" I mean stuff like the tàijíquán movement "The White Crane Spreads Its Wings"... I think you'll get the point.

# General email

## Techniques
### "The Bold Word Catches The Passing Eye": emphasizing keywords
There's only one reason we write emails: we want to comunicate with each other.

### "The Emptiness Of The Box Makes It Useful": a clutter-free inbox

### "The Accumulation Of The Useless Is Wasteful": a clutter-free account

### "The One Is One, And Is Many": multiple (maybe fake) accounts
