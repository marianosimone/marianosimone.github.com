# Being an Email Kung Fu Master
功夫 (gōngfu, or Kung Fu, as known to westerns) is a chinese concept that refers to a skill achieved through hard work and practice. Even though the westernized "Kung Fu" is almost always connected to martial arts, I use the term as it's well-known.

As the term implies, you can have Kung Fu in any skill. In this article, I'll expose some tools and techniques that I use to have a harmonious relationship with my emails. This knowledge was accumulated through the years and with the 功夫 characteristics, so I consider myself to have some sort of email功夫, and I want to document and share it with you.

# How To Read This Guide
The techniques and weapons (tools) are separated in three sections: "Writting Emails", "Managing email" and "GMail-specific". This distinction is because GMail has changed the way email is writen/read/managed in such a way that many of the things you can do with it are not available in other contexts (luckily, this seems to be changing thanks to plugins for other email-clients)

All techniques will have a name inspired by the kind-of-esoteric way Kung Fu movements (now I AM referring to Kung Fu as a martial art) are named. By "esoteric" I mean stuff like the tàijíquán movement "The White Crane Spreads Its Wings"... I think you'll get the point.

# Writting emails
## Techniques
### "The Words That Flow Alone": keeping it short
> The good, if brief, is two times good

There’s only one reason we write emails: we want to comunicate with each other. Sometimes, it may be just small-talk, but more often than not, we want to say something that the reader can understand, take into consideration and even remember.

There are some [radical approaches](http://three.sentenc.es/) to maintain some discipline on [writting short emails](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/18/3-sentence-emails/), but I tend to follow the following rule of thumb:

- One sentence to (re)introduce myself (if necessary)
- One or two sentences to explain the issue at hand. It may be a summary of a project I'm working on, a movie I recently watched or a product I want to buy or make a complaint about.
- One sentence to express what I'm excpecting the reader to do about that issue. It may be an action, a reply, etc.

As it's been said countless times (even though I just remember about seven places where I read about [that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)), we (i.e. the one who's reading) can only handle about seven "items" at once. Remember this while writting an email, and you'll be OK.

### "The Bold Word Catches The Passing Eye": emphasizing keywords
*This technique was taught to me by Sebastián Planes, a former student of "Problem Analysis and Solving" at [F.I.U.B.A.](http://www.fi.uba.ar)*

If you couldn't (or didn't want) to master "The Words That Flow Alone" techinque, it's useful to **let the other(s) know** at a glance what are the **key points** of your message.

You can achieve this by:
- **Marking keywords** with a **bold** typeface (if you use rich-formatting)
- Using UPPERCASE letters (as it's [considered shouting in netiquette](http://email.about.com/od/netiquettetips/qt/Writing-In-All-Caps-Is-Like-Shouting.htm), you should avoid using it too much)
- Using \_\_Some Kind Of Custom Notation\_\_

### "If One Goes, One Returns. If Many Go, One Returns": keep one question per mail (or at least per line)
Humans are bad at handling questions. I've found, many times, that asking more than one thing at a time may let you without answers (at least, with less answers than questions). I used to write emails like this one (I removed formalities for the sake of simplicity):

> I'd like to know where can I find X, as well as your opinion on X regarding Y. Do you think I should use it along with Z?

Oh, the humanity! A common reply to this would be something of this sort:

> You can get X at A, B or C

Mhhh... What about the other questions?

So, this technique is based on making clear what you expect to recieve answers for. I think that the best way is to send just one question per email (and this is specially true if it's your first communication with the reciever, because you don't know she/he is on handling multiple questions)

Question:

> I'd like to know where can I find X?

Reply:

> You can get X at A, B or C

Asking again:

> Thanks a lot
> There's another question I'd like to ask: What do you think of X?

As this may be cumbersome, a less verbose solution would be to use bullets to make it clear that there is more than one question to be answered:

> - Where can I find X?
> - What do you think of X?
> - Do you think I should use it along with Z?

# Managing email
### "The Emptiness Of The Box Makes It Useful": a clutter-free inbox
You can define the usefulness of many objects by its emptiness. For example, a window if useful because of the emptiness inside it's frame. A cup can contain liquids because it's empty (yeah, I know what you're thinking... it's full of air... just grow up).

Similarly, an email inbox is most useful when it's empty. [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com/) is a kind of movement started by [Merlin Mann](http://merlinmann.com/) that focuses on keeping a clean inbox, as a consequence of an empty brain regarding the handling of each message, as well as the time you waste thinking about it.

Keeping a clutter-free inbox is not a technique by itself, but the confirmation that you are managing your email effectively. Take a look at your inbox right now. How many emails are sitting there? 10? 100? 1000? (I've seen people with over 5000 emails in there). Those numbers can be overwhelming. A simple way to start cleaning it up is:
- Take all at-least-one-month-old-email: Send them to "I don't think I'll need this" quarentine
- Take all at-least-one-week-old-email: Send them to "I'll take a look" quarentine
- Take at least 10 of the remaining emails on your inbox: Handle them (repeat until inbox is empty)
- When your inbox is empty, go to the "I'll take a look" quarentine "folder": Repeat the previous step with its messages
- When that quarentine is empty, move to the "I don't think i'll need this" emails: Mark them all as read, archive them... If you didn't feel the need to handle them before, you probably won't (ever). 

Once your inbox is (almost) empty, keep it that way. Your worflow should be something like:
 - Email in
 - Email handled (replied, archived, reported as spam :P, snoozed)
 - Email removed from inbox 

### "The Accumulation Of The Useless Is Wasteful": a clutter-free account

### "The One Is One, And Is Many": multiple (maybe fake) accounts

## Weapons
### "Kunai": Handle it later
Like [Scorpio's weapon](http://mortalkombat.wikia.com/wiki/Kunai), email can be asked to return later. Sometimes, there's a message you won't be handling right now, and you don't want it cluttering your inbox, do you?

The simplest (and smartest) way of achieving this, so far, is using Gmail Snooze, a Google App Script that gives you some tags to apply to your emails (like Snooze 1 day, Snooze 2 days... you get the idea, right?).

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="publications/mail-gongfu/img/snooze-gmail.png" alt="Applying a snooze tag to an email"/>
</div>

To install (and, if you want, understand) it, just follow the guide at [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5825634/how-to-add-a-snooze-button-to-gmail-no-extensions-required) or the [Google Apps Developer Blog](http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2011/07/gmail-snooze-with-apps-script.html)

Another option (wich I have not tested, as I don't like the 3rd party browser-extension approach) is [Boomerang](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/). The good thing about is that not only snoozes emails, but it also allows you to schedule messages. If you trust this guys enough, you should check'em out.
