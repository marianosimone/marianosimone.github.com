                <h1>üí≠ The case against "should"</h1>
                <p>"Should" is a very ambiguous word, and I'd like to make a case against using it in most contexts, and especially when describing the expected or desired behavior of a complex system.</p>

                <p>Take, this, for example:.</p>
                <blockquote>The configuration of the FooBar service should limit retires</blockquote>
                <p>This can mean <em>at least</em> two different things:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The current implementation limits retries, but evidence shows that it didn't in this case</li>
                  <li>An ideal implementation limits retries, but that's not the current one</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Given that natural languages are so ambiguous, "should" ranks very low in my choice of words (specially in written communication, which removes all non-verbal cues)</p>
                <p>A wise friend of mine (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dodgejoel/">Joel Dodge</a>) gave me this example a while ago:</p>
                <blockquote>Instead of ‚ÄúX should Y‚Äù, I sometimes say ‚ÄúMy understanding is that X does Y. If it is not currently true that x is y, then I am surprised‚Äù</blockquote>
                <p>This is more verbose, but the cost of verbosity is small, and the cost of lack of clarity compounds pretty quickly!</p>
                <p>So, here's my challenge: next time you are about to use "should" without any extra context, see if you can reword your statement to make it unambiguous. Words are mostly free, but the back and forth until people understand you might not be.</p>
                <p>PS: This does not apply to cases where ‚Äúshould‚Äù is unambiguous, like when following <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119: Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</a> (thanks <a href="https://jeremymikkola.com">Jeremy Mikkola</a> for reminding me of this!)</p>
