title: "üå≤The Solver's Progression Model (Do-Lead-Explore)"

description: "A three-stage model for understanding progression in any discipline: Do, Lead, and Explore"
---

When talking about progression in any discipline, I've come to believe that there are three main stages:

- In the first stage, *"Do"*, *you are solving tasks*. You are usually presented with the description of a problem or job to be done, the solution or specific steps to follow, and are sent on your merry way. Your expected output is completing *what* you've been asked to do.
- In the second stage, *"Lead"*, *you are solving problems*. You may be given the description of a problem or job to be done, and it's up to you to figure out a solution or steps to follow. Now, you are expected to both define the *how*, and also "Do" what you proposed.
- In the third stage, *"Explore"*, *you are finding problems worth solving*. You are out there in the world, it is up to you to discover what needs to be done, *why*, and either come up with solutions, or delegate that to people in the "Lead" stage.

One way to think about this is as three concentric circles:

![Concentric circles, from smaller to biggest: Do, Lead, Explore](/img/progression_concentric.png)

However, a more realistic way of visualizing is this:

![More realistic model: Do is a circle, Lead is a , Explore](/img/progression_real.png)

Here, we can more clearly see:

- Do: Clearly defined boundaries, and mostly inside what instructed (although some creativity might be appreciated!)
- Lead: Somehow defined boundaries, but them being less uniform (not everything the leader does has the same shape)
- Explore: Unclear boundaries, going in different directions (with spikes, and retractions)

## In practice

I've used this model to guide lots of career conversations (including my own!), in particular for software engineers. Even if that's not what you do, you can certainly use the same framework (if you do, drop me a line, I'd love to help you apply it, and/or hear about how it worked - or didn't - for you).

Let's take an example from the software industry:

| Stage | Software Engineer Level | How it looks like |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Do | Trainee-New Grad-Junior | *Input*: "We need users to authenticate into our site. They'll use one-time tokens that are generated on-demand, sent to their emails, and expire in 5 minutes. Tokens are generated with the X algorithm, and stored in Y. Users can request Z tokens in a T period, and then have a S cooldown period"<br/>*Output*: "Code, test, get reviews, deploy" |
| Lead | Semi Senior-Senior | *Input*: "We need users to authenticate on our site. We are thinking about one-time login tokens (a common pattern, with relatively well known pros and cons), but are open to other options that provide similar friction/security trade-offs"<br/>*Output*: "Research one-time login token solutions, compare with alternatives, propose a solution, and either 'Do', or guide someone"<br/>Output: "Code, test, get reviews, deploy" |
| Explore | Staff-Principal | *Input*: Hard-hitting reality<br/>*Output*: "We have this site that contains private data, and users want to access it... we  want to keep a good balance between security and friction/ease of use. Alice is ready to tackle a project on her own from end to end; I wonder if she'd be interested in implementing a one-time token solution or find a better alternative. Maybe she can even get some help from Bob, who just joined us back after his internship last summer"* |

* Note that the "Explore" example takes many things into account: from the problem to solve (authentication), success criteria (security vs ease of use), and team dynamics (Alice, Bob). Depending on team composition, there might be more or less interaction with an Engineering Manager; I think that at this level you always need to have a good grasp of your teammates' skills, but not necessarily know the ins and outs of staffing, scheduling, etc.

You could also apply this to other areas of the human experience (and certainly find better examples than mine, as you probably need to be at the "Explore" level to do an analysis like this). Take, for example, cooking:

| Stage | How it looks like |
|-------|-------------------|
| Do | *Input*: "This is a recipe for pizza. Take these ingredients, follow these steps, enjoy".<br/>*Output*: A good pizza! üçï |
| Lead | *Input*: "Hey, these are some ingredients in your fridge/pantry, you've obviously eaten food in the past, and I'm hungry!"<br/>*Output*: "I know that tomato and basil is always a good pairing, and maybe I can add some garlic so it has a spicy kick... I could experiment with whole-wheat flour this time!"... And then a good Margherita pizza üçï |
| Explore | *Input*: Hard-hitting reality (and gluttony!).<br/>*Output*: "Mhhhh... I love blue cheese, but I'd like something that feels fresher today. Pears go really well with strong cheeses... what would happen with peaches... or strawberries?"... And then a (hopefully great) new pizza style üçï |

## Some notes on the model

- These stages are in a continuum, and your position in it is not a point, but a range: depending on the context (people around you, particular skills/tools required for a project, needs of your organization, etc.) you can be "Lead"ing today, and "Do"ing tomorrow. This is not necessarily a step back.
- One of the best ways to make progress is to try to do things that belong to the next level. Even if you are "Do"ing and are told what to do, think about other possible options and learn about them. If you are told what the problem is and find a solution, think of any adjacent ones that might come up down the line (and then communicate them to the person that came up with the original problem!)
- A corollary of the two points above is that there's a feedback loop across the stages: sometimes you need to try things out while in the Exploratory phase, so you might jump into Leading or Doing. It's important to keep a healthy balance between getting your hands dirty (to avoid building your own [ivory tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_tower)), and creating space for your teammates to grow.
- At any given point, you are only actually really good at all the previous stages, so don't feel like things are "below you" just because you are operating at a higher level. In martial arts it's said that you are only good at the basics once you get your black belt; you are not going to be a good black belt until you go beyond that. When "Lead"ing, you might end up "Do"ing your own solution, or guiding someone else.
- When "Explore"ing, you might end up "Lead"ing or "Do"ing. In the Software world, this might be true if you work in a small startup, but unheard of - and very costly - once your whole company can't have lunch at the same table anymore. The cost boils down to how bigger salaries come with expectations of higher Returns of Investment: it's important for Explorers to take a step back, both to allow (and  help!) others grow, and for them to be free to Explore (with the expectation that new areas of inquiry will give the company a competitive advantage).
- There are other ways of naming these stages, or to look at them through different lenses:
  - If you prefer nouns over verbs, another way to think about Do-Lead-Explore as Beginner-Practitioner-Expert
  - This has a lot in common with [Shuhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari), describing the path from "learning" to "mastery" in three stages: learning from what exists, detaching from them, and then finally having "no rules"
  - In the first stage, you concentrate on the "what" is being done, on the second, on "how" to do it, while on the third, you are more interested on "why" certain things need doing.
- Visualizing it as concentric circles helps find some potential pathological cases:
  - If you are "Do"ing, and outside of "Lead" too much, you might be solving tasks that are unnecessary:
    ![Concentric circles, with Do out](/img/progression_do_out.png)
  - If you are "Explore"ing, and don't overlap with "Lead"ers and "Do"ers, you might be too out of touch with reality, or they might be solving problems that are not even analyzed beforehand:
