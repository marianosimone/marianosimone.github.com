title: "Needs, Skills, and Likes: Finding the next thing to do"

description: "A framework for optimizing your next project by considering what's needed, what you're good at, and what you enjoy"
---

Whenever you are thinking of starting your next project, whether at work or for a personal endeavor, consider how you can optimize for what's "best" in the relevant context, what you are good at, and what you enjoy doing.

- "Best" is in quotation marks, because it can mean many things, depending on the context. Basically, I mean whatever is *most valuable for the entity* you are working for; this could be yourself, a team, a company, or society at large.
- Doing what you are good at ensures that you are using *your time efficiently*, and that the *results have the best chance of having the right quality*.
- And doing what you enjoyâ€¦ Do I really need to spell this out?.

Let's look at some examples:

If you are a software engineer working for a company, and your team is planning what to do next quarter, you want to prioritize projects that:

- Are aligned with the company's goals for that quarter, and long term
- You have the skills to solve
- You enjoy/believe in

Or, if you are a person, in any field, thinking about starting your own business, you want to aim for something that:

- People are willing and able to pay for
- You know about and have the skills to make it work
- You enjoy/believe in

The overlap of the three is where you want to be most of the time, but there are some caveats. Sometimes:

- You are in crunch mode and, even if you don't love something, doing it can help fulfill some needs
- You are in learning mode, so doing things that you are not good at, but are improving at, makes the "good at" space bigger in the future
- Your morale/energy is low, and doing things that you enjoy can help you improve that

As you can see from these caveats, the most important part of this technique is not to always optimize for the center, but to be conscious of where you are, and to define when and how to move around.

This way of thinking is not only useful for individuals, but also for teams. You can see how each assignment to projects or tasks falls in the diagram, and plan for learning opportunities, efficiency, and rewards. It's easier to convince someone to do something that they don't love when you show them that they can also do something else in an area they've been wanting to learn about.
