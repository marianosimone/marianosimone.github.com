description: "A hierarchy of actions to take when you encounter something that feels off"

As we start a new year, I'm also starting my 6th year at Stripe. People usually ask me how am I so "productive" (with that being defined in different ways‚Ä¶ but one shocking number is that I've merged 5,000 PRs during my time here, which is 2.75 PRs/day, 7 days a week, for 5 years, the only other entities generating so many PRs at Stripe are bots)

The answer is a mix of things. Some have to do with the way I work/think, but others are just a hierarchy of actions that I go through whenever I find something that feels off, which ends up in different types of actions.

Even though there's a certain hierarchy of how responding in one way is better than in another ("Do nothing" is almost always worse than any of the others), the value of your action will greatly depend on the situation, so it's not always true that you have to get to the last step.

So, here's the list. Whenever you encounter something that feels off (e.g. a typo, a broken link, a bug, an outdated comment, some non-idiomatic code), you could:

1. üôà **Do nothing/ignore it**: This is the easiest and fastest one! Just let it slide, and let the next poor soul deal with it! (spoiler alert: it might be you, down the line).

2. üö® **Complain non-constructively**: This is relatively easy, too. Grumbling might set off an alarm somewhere, giving some chance of a future fix. Sure, cursing might even make you feel better, but it isn't going to change much.

3. üí¨ **Start a constructive conversation**: Now we're getting somewhere! Just the fact of finding the right way of doing it starts cleaning things up (e.g. finding the right owner!). This might be starting a Slack thread, creating a ticket, writing a document and sharing it. There's a fine line between this and the previous one, but the key difference has a big impact: biasing towards action.

4. ‚úèÔ∏è **Document/add context**: Sometimes the fix is not in sight, but creating documentation and/or adding context in-place can help in the future, when someone can finally sit down and solve the problem. Explaining why something is like it is, or what was tried before and why it didn't help is invaluable!

5. üõ†Ô∏è **Fix it**: The ultimate goal! If you can fix a problem, then do it! Depending on your role and level, this might not be that you are actually rolling up your sleeves, but could be helping prioritize the issue, assigning it to someone, coordinating between teams, etc. (it's important to remember [Will Larson's Work on what matters](https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters/))

I've got lots of examples of myself choosing one of these five, with various degrees of success (I might come back to add them!), so I'm not going to judge you for defaulting to the first two, nor I'd always push for the fifth‚Ä¶ but the more we can move down the list, the better!
